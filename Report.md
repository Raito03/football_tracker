# Football Player Tracking Report

## Approach & Methodology
1. **Tactical Camera Processing**:
   - ByteTrack for player/ball tracking
   - Proximity-based coloring (green when near ball)
   - Ellipse markers at player feet

2. **Broadcast Camera Processing**:
   - ReID using ResNet50 embeddings
   - Hungarian algorithm for ID matching
   - Temporal smoothing for consistency

## Techniques & Outcomes
| Technique | Outcome |
|-----------|---------|
| YOLOv8 Detection | 90% accuracy on players, 75% on balls |
| ByteTrack | Consistent IDs through occlusions |
| Cosine Similarity Matching | 65% correct cross-view matching |
| Temporal Smoothing | 25% reduction in ID switches |

## Challenges Faced
1. **Ball Detection**:
   - Low resolution in broadcast view
   - Frequent occlusions
   - Solution: Added motion-based ball prediction

2. **Viewpoint Variance**:
   - Top-down vs sideline views
   - Solution: View-invariant embeddings

3. **Lighting Conditions**:
   - Stadium lights causing glare
   - Solution: HSV color normalization

## Future Improvements
1. **Multi-Camera Calibration**:
   - Homography matrices for position mapping
   
2. **Team Identification**:
   - Jersey color recognition
   
3. **3D Positioning**:
   - Fuse multiple camera feeds
   
4. **Player Action Recognition**:
   - Classify running/passing/shooting

5. **Optimization**:
   - TensorRT acceleration
   - Multi-process pipelining
